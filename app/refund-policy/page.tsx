          <p>
            Considering the instant download nature of digital media (software),
            it is non-returnable. There is no “trial” or “grace period” after
            purchasing any product, making all sales final. Once the software or
            service is purchased, it cannot be returned. Consequently, refunds
            cannot be provided.
          </p>

          <p>
            A refund can be processed if the downloaded product from the website
            was entirely damaged, non-functioning, or did not fulfill its
            promises.
          </p>

          <p>
            Refunds will not be granted if you choose not to use the purchased
            products. While we stand behind our products and are committed to
            assisting you with any issues, we also expect you to thoroughly
            understand your purchase and its intended purpose.
